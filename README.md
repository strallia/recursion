# Recursion

[Live Demo](https://strallia.github.io/recursion/)

# Purpose

Practice using recursions to write fibonacci and merge sort algorithms.

- function `fibsRec()` takes a positive integer as an argument and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

- function `mergeSort()` takes an array of numbers and returns an array with the numbers sorted from low to high.

# Testing

To run the functions with your own arguments, open the console and run `fibsRec(argument)` or `mergeSort(argument)`, replacing `argument` with your own.
